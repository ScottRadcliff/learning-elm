# Learning the Elm Programming Language
[Elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org/)

This is a learning experience in Elm Language. I am an open complainer of modern JavaScript and what it brings to web development. I like the idea of writing in a functional language to control the front-end code.


Not sure how I feel about the HTML/CSS parts yet.

## Getting Started
When compiling my first program [HelloWorld](https://github.com/ScottRadcliff/learning-elm/tree/master/HelloWorld), all of the instructions for grabbing the HTML package didn't work. Most things I found told me to install `evancz/elm-html`. That must not exist anymore (as of 5/14/16). It looks like that package is part of `elm-lang` now.

`elm-package install elm-lang/html`
