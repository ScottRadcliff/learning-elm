# Learning the Elm Programming Language
[Elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org/)

This is a learning experience in Elm Language. I am an open complainer of modern JavaScript and what it brings to web development. I like the idea of writing in a functional language to control the front-end code.


Not sure how I feel about the HTML/CSS parts yet.
